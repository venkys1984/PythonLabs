Basic set up 
============
pre-requisite: you need curl and git already installed

install zsh:
sudo apt install zsh

and then install oh-my-zsh:
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

Main page for oh-my-zsh : https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh

After installing oh-my-zsh, zsh automatically becomes your default shell . You can launch zsh explicitly by : /bin/zsh or /usr/bin/zsh

Like how bash shell has ~/.bashrc , zsh has ~/.zshrc.

In Terminal >> Edit >> Preferences , choose "Solarized dark" scheme and "solarized" palette

Change theme:
------------
First up , you can open that file and change the theme to "agnoster", one of the most popular themes.
Add/modify this in your .zshrc 
ZSH_THEME="agnoster"

Plugins:
-------
Add some readily available plugins:
plugins=(git z extract)
z : it gives the "z" command , which is a great way to jump folder. 
extract : gives extract command, which can extract any compressed format

# Standard plugins can be found in ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/*
# Custom plugins may be added to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)

Most plugins (should! we're working on this) include a README, which documents how to use them.

Install powerline font:(needed for most themes)
sudo apt install fonts-powerline

Autosuggestions plugins:
Autosuggestions work using your zsh history. This greatly increases your typing speed. https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
plugins=(zsh-autosuggestions) #in .zshrc

You can change the color in which autosuggestions appear:
You can edit your ~/.zshrc and change/add the variable: ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLE='fg=value'
Suggestions : I used fg=23, which I found best for Solarized dark theme
Also 
ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLE='fg=60'  # for solarized dark
ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLE='fg=180' # for solarized light 




Achieve Syntax highlighting:
----------------------------
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git
echo "source ${(q-)PWD}/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh" >> ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zshrc
